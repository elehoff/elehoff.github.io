This paper offered the ORT Technikum in Wilno, Poland (today Vilnius, Lithuania) as an example of the clash between encountered conditions and future  expectations about the nature of Jewish participation in Poland's economy shaped education and migration. I presented on a panel entitled "Dollars for Soup Kitchens: Transnational Aid Networks" as part of the POLIN Museum's 2023 [conference](https://polin.pl/en/international-conference-east-central-europe-at-the-crossroads) "East Central Europe at the Crossroads: Jewish Transnational Networks and Identities."
