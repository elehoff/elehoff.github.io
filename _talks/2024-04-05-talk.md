I presented my work on gender, kinship and minority identity in Jewish credit cooperatives in interwar Poland at the Historians of East Central Europe Workshop. This presentation focused on how these particular financial institutions drew on cultural practices around family and household in the Jewish-majority towns of Poland to promote the use of these cooperative banks.
