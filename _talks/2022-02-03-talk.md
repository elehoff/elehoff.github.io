As part of the Borns Jewish Studies Program Graduate Conference, I presented a grassroots take on the crisis of interwar Polish Jewry as seen through the research notes composed by Jewish social scientists-in-training who visited the homes of Jewish families in late 1938 and early 1939 to research family budgets. When viewed from the intimate viewpoint of a household--albeit through the eyes of an external observer--the crisis of Polish Jewry emerges as defined by questions of making a living and making a life.
