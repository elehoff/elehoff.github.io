As part of a public symposium on *yizker bikher*, I explored how using digital appraoches to these post-WWII memorial volumes from Jewish Eastern Europe can support the study of institutions that were important in local communities, such as credit cooperatives. This [symposium](https://chss.rowan.edu/centers/RCHGS/interdisciplinary-approaches-to-yizker-bikher.html) was hosted by the Rowan Center for the Study of the Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights and by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
