During this workshop for other scholars studying *yizker bikher*, I demonstrated how visualization of metadata and natural language processing can facilitate approaching the corpus of hundreds of digitized memorial books from Jewish Eastern Europe. This presentation included discussion of the digitization of these sources, their description by libraries, word frequency, keywords in context, and word vectors.
