Welcome, *borekhabo*!

My dissertation "Making a Living and Making a Life: Jewish Futures and Capitalist Crisis in Interwar Poland" takes the Jews of interwar Poland as an example of a community populated by individuals thinking through a moment of change. How do conditions make possible or foreclose imaginations of the future? What personal and communal futures are possible, and what is the relationship between the two? Under the conditions of capitalism—-and especially capitalism in crisis—-what is the connection between making a living and making a life?

My dissertation presents how contemporary actors diagnosed the condition of Polish Jewry through examining the interconnection of three problems: youth as a problem, capitalism as a problem, and the Jewish problem. This cast of writers, intellectuals, and social commentators serve to orient the reader to the ideas, practices, and institutions shaping communal efforts to respond to the problems and opportunities Jews encountered in the newly established independent Poland. These were the teachers and mentors, editors and political leaders whose frameworks would be tested by changing circumstances in the interwar period, as well as by the young people coming of age whose political and intellectual commitments were shaped by those different circumstances. The chapters of my dissertation follow those young people in the 1920s and 1930s through the institutions that sought to prepare them for their futures and the practices through which they fashioned futures for themselves. In chapters on primary schooling, vocational training, apprenticeships, communal economic relief, marriage, and childrearing, I ask how family functioned as a resource and constraint in debates about the future and the economy for the Jewish national minority of Poland.
