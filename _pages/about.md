Welcome, *borekhabo*!

This is the personal academic website for Elena Hoffenberg, PhD candidate in modern Jewish history at the University of Chicago. Please use the tabs above to view information about my publications, talks, and teaching. 

My dissertation "Making a Living and Making a Life: Jewish Futures and Capitalist Crisis in Interwar Poland" takes the Jews of interwar Poland as an example of a community populated by individuals thinking through a moment of change. How do conditions make possible or foreclose imaginations of the future? What personal and communal futures are possible, and what is the relationship between the two? Under the conditions of capitalism—-and especially capitalism in crisis—-what is the connection between making a living and making a life?

I have previously completed graduate work in Holocaust Studies at the University of Haifa and in library science at Simmons University. While completing these degrees, I served as the Digital Humanities Associate Fellow at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Before pursuing graduate studies, I worked at the Jewish Women's Archive and held a Junior Fellowship at the Library of Congress.
